- input genome as contigs set is not tested
- Add MSAProbs + hmmer alignment method for alignments with large sequences amount
- Add tree construction and repr profiles generation into get_btax_blastdb
- MultAln.improve_aln slow
- final step of get_btax_dict should be parallel
- think about RNA explorer (some predictor with high recall, precision not needed, -> get_rna_stats)
- mono btax EAGLEdb
- motive scanner (split input sequence inti windows -> calculates stats for windows -> merge significant windows)
- tblastn in multithread mode is not stable
- db_info is not final version
- HMMER multithread does not works?
- Add not only NCBI as available source
- HMMER handler may be replaced with HMM profiles handler
