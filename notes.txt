- EAGLE.lib.alignment.MultAln.remove_paralogs seems to work not always properly!
- Try to update HMMER. Do not disable POSIX parameter while building
- Move json setup out from db creation code
- "Replace" family with btax in db_creation code (more general functions)
- Add not only NCBI as available source
- HMMER handler may be replaced with HMM profiles handler
